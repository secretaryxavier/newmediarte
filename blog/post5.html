                <h2>What Are Specified Hate Groups?</h2>
                <p>
                    Specified hate groups are organized collectives, often with a clear identity and ideology, that promote hostility or violence against particular groups of people. These groups can be local or global, and they often leverage online platforms to recruit, coordinate, and amplify their message.
                </p>
                <h2>How Do They Project Hate?</h2>
                <ul class="highlight-list">
                    <li>Use of coded language and <strong>dog whistles</strong> to signal hate to insiders while maintaining plausible deniability.</li>
                    <li>Spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories to justify hostility.</li>
                    <li>Organizing campaigns that target individuals or communities for harassment or exclusion.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Why Do These Groups Form?</h2>
                <p>
                    Hate groups often emerge in response to social, economic, or political changes. Members may be motivated by fear, loss of status, or a desire for belonging. Understanding these root causes is essential to addressing the spread of organized hate.

                    <li><strong>Dog Whistle</strong>: Dog whistles are a form of symbolic communication through seemingly innocuous terms. They serve to circumvent censorship by automated moderation, allowing hate groups to signal messages to insiders while appearing harmless to outsiders.<ul style="margin-top:0.5em;">
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Terms like “family values” resonate more with Christian voters than non-Christian voters, serving as a subtle signal.</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> The number <strong>88</strong>—where 'H' is the 8th letter of the alphabet, so '88' stands for 'HH', a code for “Heil Hitler.”</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> "Globalist" as an anti-Semitic signal.</li>
</ul></li>
                    <li>Projection: Accusing others of hate or violence to justify their own actions.</li>
                    <li>Echo Chambers: Reinforcing hate within closed communities and spreading it outward.</li>
