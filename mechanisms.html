                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <h4>Algorithmic Patterns</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Algorithms are designed to maximize engagement, often pushing "rage bait" or "clickbait" regardless of its negative nature.</li>
                        <li>Interacting with specific content leads to more of the same, normalizing hate in a user's feed and perpetuating cycles of hate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Digital Amplification</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Platforms create "echo chambers" where hateful messages are amplified to much broader audiences, giving a sense of "power in numbers." </li>
                        <li>Ineffective content moderation and lack of editorial regulation allow hate to spread unchecked.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <span>&#x25BC;</span>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>The First Amendment protects most forms of speech in the United States, including protests, political commentary, social media opinions, and symbolic acts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Exception:</strong> Speech is not protected if it is intended to incite imminent violence or constitutes a real threat.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <h4>Community and Recruitment</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Marginalized hate platforms disguise themselves as online communities.</li>
                        <li>Coordinated messaging helps recruit new members and makes hate a common bond.</li>
                        <li>This leads to a rise in hate crimes and the spread of misinformation, such as fake news.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The Language of Hate</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dog Whistles:</strong> Seemingly harmless terms used to convey targeted messages, often to circumvent moderation. Example: "family values" resonating with Christian voters.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flaming:</strong> Visible, aggressive, and insulting online behavior.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trolling:</strong> Ironic provocations that exploit platform design and mask hate as "just joking."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The Creation of Hate Speech</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Three components: input emotion (e.g., fear, resentment), a processing framework (ideology or media framing), and the output (channeled emotion).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <h4>Neurological Impact</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Exposure to hate speech can shut down the empathy centers in the brain (temporo-parietal junction).</li>
                        <li>Brain scans show changes after just 15 minutes of exposure.</li>
                        <li>Desensitization occurs regardless of whether hate is directed at one's own group or others.</li>
                        <li>Dehumanizing language exploits neural circuits to propagate hatred.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Social and Cultural Impact</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Repeated exposure leads to dehumanization and makes people more prone to using derogatory language or joining hate groups.</li>
                        <li><strong>Statistic:</strong> A 2023 Ipsos poll across 16 countries found 60% of respondents encounter hate speech online "often" or "sometimes." Facebook was cited as the most widespread platform.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Case Study: COVID-19 and Anti-Asian Hate</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stay-at-home measures led to more online activity.</li>
                        <li>COVID-19 discourse increased hate crimes against Asian individuals.</li>
                        <li>'Subtle Asian Traits' Facebook group became a space for coping and resilience.</li>
                        <li>Hashtag activism: #CoronaRacism, #IAmNotAVirus.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Stricter, clearly defined laws are needed due to the dangerous effects of hate speech (e.g., deteriorating mental health).</li>
                        <li>Government restrictions must be lawful, legitimate, and proportionate.</li>
                        <li>Target hate groups and hold them accountable.</li>
                        <li>Emphasize personal responsibility, especially for parents, as children repeat what they hear.</li>
                        <li>Infuse and normalize inclusive dialogue; teach youth "how to better love instead of hate."</li>
